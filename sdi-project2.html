<article>
<p>My theme is my nightly free-time routine after the kids are in bed and once the house work and school work are completed.  I chose this theme because the first discussion post asked us to think of a daily routine that would be easy enough to form into code.</p>
<p>In my routine, I refer to the term "clan".  For those who do not play video games on-line and are not familiar with the term, it refers to a group of people who play as a team in on-line matches.</p>
